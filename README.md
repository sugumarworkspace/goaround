# GoAround - Make a move, bring your real world into the game.
Goaround is a small start which is being inspired from the "apps that part of Digital Well being experiments from google".

# What is it?
Goaround is a small start to bring your real world into game.

The idea is, have fun with your phone but without stress yourself by engulfing into the game by sitting in the same place. Instead of playing in virtual world, make a move and bring your real world into game.

To be concise, It is a kind of treasure hunt or puzzle. But you have to go around to find your treasure.

- go around and find the number plate that has numbers totalling to 5
- go around and find the 5 rupees coin with year of 2016
- go around and find the harley davidson bike

How to play?

- Install the app.
- Find the items in the list, focus on the camera and tap on <s>top of the name</s> the screen. 
- Bubble msg will show what is happening in the background. For eg., While you capture the laptop, the app may see that as computer keyboard due to the visible area. So adjust your angle and capture it again. 

Look for more play options in the future.

# How can it be done?
This can be achieved with,
- Java and Flutter
- Tensorflow Lite
- Firebase
- Few cups of coffee
- Obviously, your support and suggesstions

Auto bubble up to hint if you have captured something, but the game is seeing that as something else. So, adjust the camera angle and capture it again. :-)
