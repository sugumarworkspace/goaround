# GoAround - Make a move, bring your real world into the game.
Goaround is a small start which is being inspired from the Digital Well being experiments initiated by google recently.

# What is it?
What do you think if i say "to unlock your phone, **goaround** and scan a flower vase". The idea is, have fun with your phone but without stress yourself by engulfing into the game by sitting in the same place. Instead of playing in virtual world, make a move and bring your real world into game.

To be concise, It is a kind of treasure hunt or puzzle. But you have to **go around** to find your treasure.
- go around and find the number plate that has numbers totalling to 5
- go around and find the 5 rupees coin with year of 2016
- go around and find the harley davidson bike

# How can it be done?
This can be achieved with,
- Few cups of coffee
- Java
- Tensorflow Lite
- Firebase
- Obviously, your support and suggesstions

# How will it be?

Swipe up to see what is happening in the background. Here you have captured the laptop, but the game is seeing this as computer keyboard. So, adjust the camera angle and capture it again. :-)
